Two Makerbot Replicator+ single extruder 3D printers support fabrication of designs up
to 11.6” by 7.6” by 6.5” high (573 in3) with PLA, tough PLA, and other filaments. Using fused filament fabrication technology, they feature a flexible grip surface (non-heated bed) and 100 micron layer resolution. These 3D printers are great for rough 3D prototyping and are accessed through desktop computers in the Makerspace.
