The Makerspace on the 6th floor of UT's Technology Building provides Computer Science (CS) majors and minors with resources for rapid prototyping. It's a place where CS students can design, fabricate, assemble, and test their ideas related to projects in the Computer Science curriculum. It supports various phases of project development from design, prototyping, and testing to fabrication, assembly, and production. The Makerspace is currently only available to CS majors and minors.
